     *
     * This property is controlled with a protected method instead of an `Intent` argument
     * because the only situation where changing this value would help, is a situation in which
     * `ThrioFlutterActivity` is being subclassed to utilize a custom and/or cached [FlutterEngine].
     *
     *
     * Defaults to `true`.
     *
     *
     * Control surfaces are used to provide Android resources and lifecycle events to plugins that
     * are attached to the [FlutterEngine]. If `shouldAttachEngineToActivity` is true then
     * this `ThrioFlutterActivity` will connect its [FlutterEngine] to itself, along with any
     * plugins that are registered with that [FlutterEngine]. This allows plugins to access the
     * `Activity`, as well as receive `Activity`-specific calls, e.g., [ ][Activity.onNewIntent].
     * If `shouldAttachEngineToActivity` is false, then this
     * `ThrioFlutterActivity` will not automatically manage the connection between its [ ] and itself.
     * In this case, plugins will not be offered a reference to an `Activity` or its OS hooks.
     *
     *
     * Returning false from this method does not preclude a [FlutterEngine] from being
     * attaching to a `ThrioFlutterActivity` - it just prevents the attachment from happening
     * automatically. A developer can choose to subclass `ThrioFlutterActivity` and then invoke
     * [ActivityControlSurface.attachToActivity] and [ ][ActivityControlSurface.detachFromActivity]
     * at the desired times.
     *
     *
     * One reason that a developer might choose to manually manage the relationship between the
     * `Activity` and [FlutterEngine] is if the developer wants to move the [ ] somewhere else.
     * For example, a developer might want the [FlutterEngine] to outlive this `ThrioFlutterActivity`
     * so that it can be used later in a different `Activity`. To accomplish this, the [FlutterEngine]
     * may need to be disconnected from this `FluttterActivity` at an unusual time, preventing this
     * `ThrioFlutterActivity` from correctly managing the relationship between the [FlutterEngine] and itself.
